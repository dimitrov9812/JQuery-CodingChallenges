# JQuery-CodingChallenges

<h2>Hangman</h2>
 -A traditional game of hangman.<br/>
 -You get a random word from a .txt file and try to understand what is it.<br/>
 -You have 6 mistakes max until your character dies.<br/>
 -If you win or loose you get a chance to press the button play again and get new word.<br/>
 -I have and error i have to fix with reading the .txt file with the words. It runs well when i run it from VScode but when i       load the index.html file in with another browser it wont display the word.<br/>
 
 <h2>NeyYearsCountdown</h2>
 -This is a simple countdown app which as you can tell displays the time left to a certain event.<br/>
 -In the beginning it was planned to be only for New Year.<br/>
 -Then i made some changes and added the possibility to choose from 6 differrent holidays.<br/>
  -Christmas.<br/>
  -New Years Eve.<br/>
  -Easter.<br/>
  -Thanksgiving.<br/>
  -Halloween.<br/>
  -Valentine's day.<br/>
 -I have the same problem as with the Hangman but this time it doesn't load the font and i am working on a solution.<br/>
 
  <h2>MovieTheatre</h2>
   -This is application that uses movie API and lets the user pick a movie and see information about it and also reserve a seat.<br/>
   -First i hardcoded the movie choices.<br/>
   -The seats update every time a new movie is selected and also the price is being changed.<br/>
   -When you select a seat it turns purple and you can deselect it.<br/>
   -Later i decided that a person should be able to search for a movie that is not available  and also see the same information about it.<br/>
   -After making the app i got a way better understanging of how work with API is done.<br/>
   -Also improved my JQuery knowledge.<br/>
   -Soon i can update the looks of the website.<br/>
 
 
<h2>ExchangeRateCalculator</h2>
 -This app uses API of exchange rates<br/>
 -It gets the desired currency and the desired amount<br/>
 -Then calculates it and return the value of the currency pair<br/>
 -You have a swap button for a faster change between the two currencies selected instead of going trough the select options again<br/>
 
 <h2>ToDo APP</h2>
 -A simple to do app built with JQuery.<br/>
 -It gets the user input and adds it as a task.<br/>
 -The task has two options after being added- remove it completely from the list or mark it as complete.<br/>
 -The maximum number of tasks we can have is 10.<br/>
 -On the top we have a nice nature background with the current day name,date,month and the opportunity to change the background if needed.<br/>
